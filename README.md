# DSmackyBall

A Pong game written in the D programming language with the Dgame library.

Of course the ball is actually a square, but we'll just overlook that.

The project has been created and is being managed by the DUB D packaging tool.  To build the project, once D and DUB are installed, simply enter into the top-level of the code directory and run "dub build".
